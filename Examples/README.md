# Examples

Collection of exemplary scripts demonstrating the usage of ctapipe for the analysis of CTA Monte Carlo simulations. For running the example short runlists for gammas and protons are given in [Runlists](Runlists/). Each line represents one file that should be analyzed. A telescope configuration with on telescope ID per line is given in [Arrays](Arrays/).

## Short description

* [**Submit_batch_farm**](Submit_batch_farm): Submission of ctapipe jobs to the DESY batch farm. 

* **under construction**: Writing out feature lists for classifier of primary particle type and energy regressor including informations of the Hillas reconstruction.
